题目描述

Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. 
Find that single one.

Note: 
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement 
it without using extra memory?


public class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] A) {
        int ones = 0; //记录只出现过1次的bits
        int twos = 0; //记录只出现过2次的bits
        int threes = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<A.length;i++){
            int t = A[i];
            twos |= ones & t; //要在更新ones前面更新twos
            ones ^= t;
            threes = ones & twos; //ones和twos中都为1即出现了3次
            ones &= ~threes; //抹去出现了3次的bits
            twos &= ~threes; //抹去出现了3次的bits
        }
        return ones;
    }
}
